# Joseph Sluterbeck - Computer Science

# Personal Projects:
1. GrumpyChef
> The first project I will be working on this semester is a group project in which we will create a website that will allow users to inventory ingredients in their home, create and share recipes, and generate shopping carts. The application will be a multi-user platform.
   
2. Portfolio Website
> The second project I will attempt to work on this semester will be a customized personal portfolio website. Ideally, it would contain all of my relevant links, my resume, information about me, and jobs I am seeking. I would customize it to be navigated easily and aesthetically pleasing.
